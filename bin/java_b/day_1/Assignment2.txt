a.  Exposed -> Student name, ID
    Hidden -> DOB, Year, Courses registered, Marks
b. Since the marks are calculated on a per subject basis for the semester we need not write different logic for different student/course type. So single method with marks obtained and total marks as parameters can be used to calculate the absolute grade.
c. Two functions, one for common tuition fee and another for hosteller fee, which would return 0 directly if the student type variable is day scholar.
